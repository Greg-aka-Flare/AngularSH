        <article><h3>After joining <span class="shrpr"><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>r</span><span>p</span><span>r</span></span>, what makes this company different? </h3>
<p>The really cool thing about shrpr is that everyone involved in the creation of it is so passionate and enthusiastic about it. We're all invested in the growth and success of shrpr, so it's great to see all of these people from different backgrounds coming together to work on a common goal.</p>
<h3>How do you learn new things?</h3>
<p>I use Google all the time to search for answers. If I'm ever wondering how to do something or if there's something I'm curious about, Google is my go-to. From there I can usually find a reliable source to find out what I want to know.</p>
<h3>What is the one thing that you have always wanted to learn, but just have not had the chance to?</h3>
<p>There are a lot of things I'd like to learn. I would love to learn how to play the piano, how to rock climb, beekeeping, and blacksmithing, to name a few.</p>
