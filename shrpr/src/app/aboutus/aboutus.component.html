    <p>Shrpr makes sure to provide a transparent view into the courses and teachers hosting on our platform. We want to make sure that every course taught by every teacher is high quality, and that you are signing up to learn from experts, not amateurs. We do this through our review and rating system as well as an in depth screening process before allowing courses to be hosted on shrpr.</p>
    <h2>Face to Face</h2>
    <p>Shrpr is NOT online learning. All of the classes hosted on shrpr meet in a face to face, group environment.
