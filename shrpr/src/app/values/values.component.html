<h1>Our Values</h1>
<p>At <span class="shrpr"><span>s</span><span>h</span><span>r</span><span>p</span><span>r</span></span>, we are guided by our Massive Transformative Purpose and Values. These are more than just words on paper or hung on the wall. These are things that the company as a whole, and each person within it, live and breathe every day, inside and outside of work.</p>
<p>Massive Transformative Purpose: Write the new track for face to face learning and education</p>
<p><strong>Values:</strong><br>Seek New Knowledge - We want everyone to strive to be more valuable tomorrow than they are today. Seek training. Seek coaching. Read books. Help your peers and yourself constantly achieve new heights. Knowledge is power, and we believe the only way to win in any competitive situation is to be more prepared than your opponent.</p>
<p>Be Nice - Be a good co-worker, be a good neighbor, be a good human. Strive to leave the world you go to bed to better off than that you woke up to. In order for us to achieve our goals, we need to be surrounded by a team of passionate and positive peers.</p>
<p>Think Positively - the glass is always half full, never half empty. Positive mindsets will lead to positive outcomes. Sure, bad things happen, but positivity will lessen and shorten the blow. By seeking the good in other people and the world that surrounds you, your positive energy will be contagious and help others be positive too. Optimism wins over pessimism every time.</p>
